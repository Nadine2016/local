IBMÂ® uses cloud operations as a service to monitor and maintain your environment, so that you can focus on building apps and services that run on top of the environment. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} also handles platform updates, so that you can focus on the business.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} environments have the same security standards as the public {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} in terms of operational security. You provide the hardware and infrastructure, which gives you control over infrastructure and physical [security](/docs/security/index.html#localplatformsecurity). Developer access to the local {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment is controlled by your LDAP policies, which can be configured by the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} team when they set up your environment. Within the local environment, using the Administration page, you can [manage users and permissions](/docs/admin/index.html#oc_useradmin).

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} comes with all included {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} runtimes and 64 GB of compute memory.

## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} architecture
{: #localarch}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} sits on a virtualized infrastructure that is behind your Enterprise firewall, providing the highest performing and most secure cloud infrastructure to you. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} installs, remotely monitors, and manages {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} in your data center through {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}'s [Relay](#localrelay) technology. The logical architecture in [Figure 1](#figure01) describes how {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is set up in your local environment and how {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} maintains your local instance:

![{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} architecture.](images/bmlocal_arch.png "Bluemix Local architecture diagram")

Figure 1. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} architecture
{: #figure01}

The inception virtual machine (inception VM) runs on your enterprise virtualized infrastructure behind your enterprise firewall. The inception VM creates an outbound network connection to the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Operations center through the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} relay technology. Relay performs several functions and is described in following [Relay](#localrelay) section.

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform components and core features that support the platform components run in a private, isolated virtual local area network (VLAN). {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} uses a VLAN for the private subnet. Using a private subnet rather than a public VLAN is more secure and can help avoid routing issues. The set of core features that make up and support the platform include the following:

<dl>
<dt>Platform</dt>
<dd>At a minimum, the platofrm is Cloud Foundry components and some local application services. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} provides both Cloud Foundry and {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}-based compute environments. An enterprise may have one or both of these compute environments configured.<br>
An enterprise may also add additional local application services.<br>
<p>Refer to [Optional components for purchase: Services add-ons](#table02) and [Optional components for purchase: Platform add-ons](#table03) for additional services and compute capabilities that may be added.</p>
</dd>
<dt>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public</dt>
<dd>
A {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} environment might have an outbound connection to a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public region. A connection to public enables syndication of public services onto the local catalog. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public service syndication provides a convenient method for developers to build applications hosted on the enterprise's {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} environment as well as access to services running in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public. See the list of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} services that can be syndicated from {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public in the [Syndicated catalog](#cataloglocal) section.
</dd>
<dt>{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Operations</dt>
<dd>
{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} manages, monitors, and maintains the local platform and local services, so that you can focus on building innovative applications. The {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Operations Support Services (OSS) team performs operations by using a VPN tunnel connection from the inception VM to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}'s Operations network.
</dd>
<dt>Enterprise</dt>
<dd>
The enterprise network environment has a bi-directional network link to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}}. This allows applications hosted in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} to access services and resources in the enterprise, including data sources and enterprise services. The network link also allows {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} to use your LDAP for authentication of your developers and administrators.
</dd>
<dt>Local services</dt>
<dd>A set of services are available to be used privately in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} environment. Typically, you decide which services you want for your environment prior to the deployment by the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} team. For a list of available services, go to [Local services and runtimes](#table01).
</dd>
<dt>DataPower Gateway</dt>
<dd>
{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} DataPower Gateway appliances provide access to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application domains. These appliances connect to your intranet network and to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} private network, providing a secure gateway to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} deployment. Your developers, who are deploying apps and services, get access from your intranet through this gateway. The users of the applications will get access through the DataPower appliances as well as your administrators.
</dd>
<dt>Security intelligence</dt>
<dd><p>{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} uses QRadar Security Intelligence Platform to provide a unified architecture for integrating several key components. These components include security information and event management, log management, anomaly detection, incident forensics, and configuration and vulnerability management. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also uses {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} QRadar security information and event management (SIEM) to monitor privileged user actions and successful and unsuccessful login attempts of application developers. QRadar reports provide the customer with visibility on by using the Reports and Logs section on the Administration page. For information about security reports, see [Viewing reports](/docs/admin/index.html#oc_report).</p>
<p>{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} BigFix ensures that fixes for operating systems are applied at appropriate frequencies. The patching process is automated, and the schedule is agreed upon between you and IBM. For information about maintenance and upgrades, see [Maintaining your local instance](index.html#maintainlocal).</p>
</dd>
</dl>

Your apps are deployed inside virtual containers that run on Cloud Foundry virtual machines. All Cloud Foundry components, such as cloud controllers, health managers, routers, and droplet execution agents (DEAs) are deployed when {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is set up. The various {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} management components are also included in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} deployment.
